<h3>American Horror story</h3>
<p>The depth of this series is exceptional and it always manages to take me through an interesting adventure.</p>

<h3>Haunting of Hill house</h3>
<p>My favourite series hands down. The beauty of the story, the twists and turns. The emotion this movie can draw out and on top of it all still shock watchers with a jumpscare here and there.</p>
